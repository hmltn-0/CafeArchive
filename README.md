# NCategory Cafe Archiver

## Description

NCategory Cafe Archiver is a tool designed to periodically crawl and archive the [NCategory Cafe website](https://golem.ph.utexas.edu/category/). Its primary purpose is to preserve the content as a backup, ensuring that the information remains accessible even if the original site becomes unavailable. This can be considered a mirror of the NCategory Cafe website, providing a reliable copy of the online content.

### Running Your Own Crawler

If you wish to run your own crawler, perhaps to preserve another academic site or in the event that this crawler goes down, refer to the installation instructions in the [Installation](#installation) section above.

For detailed information on configuring and running the crawler, including crawling strategy, frequency, and more, please refer to the [Documentation.pdf](Documentation.pdf) included in the repository.
